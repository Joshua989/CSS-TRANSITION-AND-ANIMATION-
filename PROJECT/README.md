 In the provided CSS code, there are two transition properties used: `transition` and `transform`. Let me explain each of them:

1. **`transition` Property:**
   - The `transition` property in CSS is a shorthand property that allows you to define the transition effects on an element. It specifies the property to which a transition effect should be applied, the duration of the transition, the timing function that defines the speed curve of the transition, and an optional delay before the transition starts.

   - In the header section, the transition property is used to create a smooth color transition for the background color and the anchor text color. Here's the breakdown of its usage in the provided code:

     ```css
     header {
         /* ... */
         transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
     }

     header nav ul li a {
         /* ... */
         transition: color 0.3s ease;
     }
     ```

   - In both cases, the transition effect lasts for `0.3` seconds (`0.3s`). The `ease` timing function is used, which means the transition starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and slows down again at the end, creating a smooth and natural animation effect.

2. **`transform` Property:**
   - The `transform` property in CSS is used for transforming elements in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. It can be used for various transformation functions such as `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`, etc.

   - In the provided code, the `transform` property is used in the `section:hover` selector to create a scaling effect on the sections when hovered over:

     ```css
     section:hover {
         transform: scale(1.05);
         background-color: #f9f9f9;
     }
     ```

   - When a `section` element is hovered over, it scales up by `1.05` times its original size (`transform: scale(1.05);`). The transition effect is applied here implicitly because a change in the `transform` property triggers a transition by default.

These transition properties enhance the user experience by making the color changes and scaling actions smooth and visually appealing, providing a more interactive feel to the website.



In the provided example:

```css
header nav ul li a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
    position: relative;
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
}
```

Here, the `transition` property is applied to the `color` property of anchor links (`<a>`). When the color of the anchor links changes, the transition effect takes 0.3 seconds (`0.3s`) with an `ease` timing function, making the color change smooth and gradual.

### `::after` Pseudo-element:
The `::after` pseudo-element in CSS is used to insert content after an element's existing content. It is often used to create decorative elements or effects, such as the underline effect in the example. Here's how it is used:

```css
header nav ul li a::after {
    content: '';
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -2px;
    left: 0;
    width: 0;
    height: 2px;
    background-color: greeny;
    transition: width 0.3s ease;
}
```

In this example, the `::after` pseudo-element is used to create an underline effect for the anchor links. The `content: '';` line ensures that the pseudo-element has empty content. The `position: absolute;` positions the pseudo-element relative to its closest positioned ancestor. The `bottom: -2px;` positions the underline 2 pixels above the baseline of the text.

The `transition` property is applied to the `width` property of the pseudo-element, creating a smooth transition effect. When you hover over the anchor links, the `width` property changes from `0` to `100%`, making the underline smoothly expand from left to right.



header nav ul li a:hover::after {
    width: 100%;
}
when you hover over it the width changes from let to right to 100%
